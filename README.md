Gitanshu2409's GitHub Repository 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Gitanshu2409, and I am a dedicated tech enthusiast with a profound interest in technology and coding. My journey in this field began at an early age, and I am eager to explore the extensive opportunities that programming offers.

My Beliefs 🙏
    - Loves when Software is free as in transparency and free to use. 🌍
    - Solves obscure mathematics and studies physics for fun. 🤓
    - Prefers using linux in place of windows. 🤵‍♂️
    - Admires logical arguments and simplicity (optional).
    - Learns the next cool thing and can stare at techincal equipment for whole day (seriously).
    - Did graphic designing many times just to get the right minecraft texture pack. 🖌️
    - Doesn't know a lot but tries to be helpful (though he never is).
    - Wouldn't mind if i do the work and ChatGPT writes the report/conclusion.
    
My Coding Journey 💻

    HTML: I commenced my coding journey at the age of 9. 🌐
    Python: I have developed strong passion for Python since I began learning it at the age of 12 or 11 i believe 
    (didn't get true essence of programming then so i couldn't get it well but now that isn't the case). 🐍
    Java: I acquired knowledge of Java at the age of 13 (when i actually understood programming) for which i really developed a strong passion. ☕
    Linux: I embraced Linux when I was about 13, and I have been a die-hard fan ever since. 🐧
    Lua & Haskell: I have explored these languages and find them intriguing. 🔍 (Everything but 1 based indexing ☠️ and Haskell's Beautiful Complexity ☠️☠️)

Current Focus 🎯

    Data Structures & Algorithms: I am currently focused on building a solid foundation in these essential concepts. 📊
    Competitive Programming: I enjoy engaging in challenges that enhance my problem-solving skills. 🏆
    Artificial Intelligence & Neural Networks: I am enthusiastic about the advancements in AI and am keen to deepen my understanding of neural networks and Large Language Models (LLMs). 🤖
    FOSS Contribution: I am passionate about contributing to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and believe in the power of community-driven development. 🌍
    Microcontroller Programming : Newly developed interest willing to pursue it as soon as possible. 🔌
